A SwiftUI `Picker` view is a control that lets you pick a value from a set of options. The `Picker` will adjust its looks to the context (different for iOS, macOS, or watchOS). It can look like the `UIKit` component called a `UISegmentedControl` (or segmented control) with proper configuration.

##

![Segmented Control in SwiftUI](segmented-control-in-swiftui)

You can use segmented control to switch a given screen's content, for example, on filters or a list of items. Read further to find out how to display Picker in segmented control style and track element changes using @State property wrapper.

The `Picker` requires a `Label` or `String`, `Binding` that will be set when an option is selected, and content - a list of options. Segmented control style won't display the label, but you should still provide it for accessibility. Simple picker configuration will look like this:

```swift
Picker("Selected section:", selection: /* Binding */) {
    Group {
        Text("All")
        Text("Favorites")
        Text("Recommended")
    }
}
```

You can use the `@State` property wrapper to use the SwiftUI build-in mechanism which refreshes your UI when the `Picker` changes. a state variable will keep selected item. A dollar sign `$` before a name of variable returns `Binding` required for the view.

```swift
@State private var selectedSection = "all"

var body: some View {
    Picker("Selected section:", selection: $selectedSection) {
        Group {
            Text("All")
                .tag("all")
            Text("Favorites")
                .tag("favorites")
           Text("Recommended")
                .tag("recommended")
        }
    }
}
```

A `tag` modifier is used by a `Picker` to know which value is selected.

When you work with pickers using `enums` should be your first choice. You can modify the code above to make it more readable and easier to maintain.

```swift
enum Section: String, Identifiable, CaseIterable {
    case all, favorites, recommended
    
    var displayName: String { rawValue.capitalized }
    
    var id: String { self.rawValue }
}
    
@State private var selectedSection = Section.all
    
var body: some View {
    Picker("Selected section:", selection: $selectedSection) {
        ForEach(Section.allCases) { section in
            Text(section.displayName)
                .tag(section)
        }
    }
}
```

That way, when you add a new element to an `enum`, it will be automatically added to the list.

There is one point of this puzzle missing. Picker supports `pickerStyle` modifier. To achieve a `UISegmentedControl` style, you have to provide `SegmentedPickerStyle` value to it. You can find the full, ready to use code below:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    private enum Section: String, Identifiable, CaseIterable {
        case all, favorites, recommended
        
        var displayName: String { rawValue.capitalized }
        
        var id: String { self.rawValue }
    }
    
    @State private var selectedSection = Section.all
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Picker("Selected section:", selection: $selectedSection) {
                ForEach(Section.allCases) { section in
                    Text(section.displayName)
                        .tag(section)
                }
            }
            .pickerStyle(SegmentedPickerStyle())
            .padding()
            Spacer()
            Text("\(selectedSection.displayName)")
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```
